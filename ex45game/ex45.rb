#This game is called "Harrow's Cave"

#You wake up in a local town's Inn, not realizing where you are. You get ready for the day and
# => eventually go outside when you see a sign for Harrow's Cave, and you immediately know where you need
# => to go.

#Harrow's Cave is a mansion inside a cave, who's owner is believed to be a vampire, but those
# => are old wives tales that were told long ago. Mr. Harrow used to have a great army and
# => the love of everybody, but past mistakes by Harrow's father cast his whole family into exile
# => causing his army to leave, and the love of the people to go.

#Now Mr. Harrow is apparently deep asleep in his cave, waiting for the time when he will be able to 
# => gain the power he once had before.
